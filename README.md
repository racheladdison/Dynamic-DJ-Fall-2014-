# Introduction
Music should not only be controlled by buttons on a screen, music is about motion and should be controlled by motion as well. The purpose of this project is to create a wearable music playing device that allows the user to adjust settings of music using their hands. This technology can be used by dancers who want to be able to change their music they are listening to without having to get their music player out of their pocket or pause their dancing. The Dynamic DJ will read input from the userâ€™s hands and given a certain combination of motions, the settings of the music will be changed accordingly.
